Known Bugs
1. Can't run against multiple tv shows.  Fetches the first show's id and goes with it


Wishes
1. GUI to stage renames and make regular expression formatting easier.
2. Investigate modifying video tags (like id3 for tv)
3. Full plugin system so that you can scrape info from more than TV Rage
4. Develope automated testing suite
